# Babun - a windows shell you will love!

Install:
TODO

What is so cool about babun:
* it is a bundled and tweaked Cygwin
* it provides an automatic, silent command-line installer
* it can be installed without admin rights on Windows hosts
* it provides a linux-like package manager called pact (similar to e.g. apt-get)
* it provides a xterm-256 compatible console
* it natively supports HTTP proxying
* it is really cool :)
