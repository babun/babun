== Development

=== Project structure

The project consists of five modules.

==== babun-packages

The main goal of the +babun-packages+ module is to download the cygwin packages listed in the +conf/cygwin.x86.packages+ file.
The abovementioned packages will be downloaded together with the whole dependency tree. Repositories which the packages are downloaded from are listed in the +conf/cygwin.repositories+ file. At the beginning the first repository is taken, if a package is not available in this repo the second repo is used, etc. The process continues until all packages have been downloaded. 

All downloaded packages are stored in the +target/babun-packages+ folder.

==== babun-cygwin

The main goal of the +babun-cygwin+ module is to download and invoke the native cygwin.exe installer. The packages downloaded by the babun-packages module are used as the input - all of them will be installed in the offline cygwin installation. 

It is not trivial to install and zip a local instance of Cygwin - there are problems with the symlinks as the symlink-file-flags are lost during the compression process. Babun can work it around though. At first, just after the installaion, the +symlinks_find.sh+ script is invoked in order to store the list of all cygwin's symlinks. This file is delivered as a part of the the babun's core. Then, after babun is installed from the zip file on the user's host the +symlinks_repair.sh+ script is invoked - it will correct all the broken symlinks listed in the abovementioned file.

Preinstalled cygwin is located in the +target/babun-cygwin+ folder.

==== babun-core

The main goal of the +babun-core+ module is to install babun's core along with all the plugins and tools. +install.sh+ script is invoked during the creation of the distribution package in order to preinstall the plugins. Whenver babun is installed on the user's host the +install_home.sh+ script is invoke in order to install the babun-related files to the cygwin-user's home folder.

Preinstalled cygwin with installed babun is located in the +target/babun-cygwin+ folder.

==== babun-dist

The main goal of the +babun-dist+ module is to zip the ready-made instance of babun, copy some installation scripts and zip the distributrion.

Distribution package is located in the +target/babun-dist+ folder.

==== babun-doc

This module contains documentation written in ASCIIDOC.


=== Building from source

The project is regularly build on Jenkins, on a slave node featurint the Windows Server OS. The Windows OS is required to fully build the distribution package as one of the goals invokes the native +cygwin.exe+ installer. The artifacts created by each module are cached/stored in the target folder after a successful build of each step. This mechanism is not intelligent enough to calculate the diffs so if you would like to fully rebuild the whole dist package make sure to invoke the +clean+ goal before the +package+ goal. For now it's not possible to invoke a build of a selective modules only. 

In order to build the dist package invoke:
----
groovy build.groovy package 
----

In order to clean the project target folder invoke:
----
groovy build.groovy clean 
----

In order to publish the release version to bintray invoke:
----
groovy build.groovy release
----
The release goal expects the following environment variables: +bintray_user+ and +bintray_secret+

=== Developing a plugin

Every plugin has to consist of three main files:

* install.sh - a file that will be invoke during the creation of the babun's distribution
* install_home.sh - a file that will be invoked during the installation of babun to the user's home folder 
* plugin.desc - a plugin description that contains the plugin_name and plugin_version variables

Have a look at the pact plugin - it's a perfect example of a relatively small plugin using all the features.

==== install.sh

Its main responsibility is to install the plugin - for example to copy the plugin files to, e.g. +/usr/local/etc+ or +/usr/local/bin+ directories. install.sh script is also responsbile for preparing the user's home folder template. The template files have to be copied to the +/usr/local/babun/home/<plugin_name>+ folder.

install.sh will be invoked many times - on every plugin update if the plugin version is higher than the version of the installed plugin - thus it's logic has to work in an incremental way. This mechanism is invoked automatically though. The plugin does not have to contain the version check.

The script has to begin with the following statement:
----
#!/bin/bash
set -e -f -o pipefail
source "/usr/local/etc/babun/source/babun-core/tools/script.sh"
----

==== install_home.sh

Its main responsbility is to configure the user's home folder with the plugin releated stuff, if necessary. For example, it may copy the files from the +/usr/local/babun/home/<plugin_name>+ folder to the user's home folder.
It is also responsible for any other things that may be necessary during the user's home configuration process.

install_home.sh will be invoked many times - on every plugin update if the plugin version is higher than the version of the installed plugin - thus it's logic has to work in an incremental way.

Both scripts (install.sh and install_home.sh) scripts have to begin with the following statement:
----
#!/bin/bash
set -e -f -o pipefail
source "/usr/local/etc/babun/source/babun-core/tools/script.sh"
----

==== plugin.desc

A plugin descriptor looks like this:
----
# plugin descriptor
plugin_name=pact
plugin_version=1
----

Every time the plugin is changed the version has to be incremented. Otherwise the newest version will not be installed.

=== Branches

The babun's repository contains three main branches:
* master - development branch
* candidate - release candidate branch, no direct commmits, only fast forwards from the master/other branch
* release - release, no direct commits, only fast forwards from the candidate branch

In order to check babun update agains other branch (for example during a development of a plugin), set the babun_branch variable to (master or candidate). External repo's are not supporter (this mechanism has to be extended to include user's repos).

=== Folder structure in Cygwin

An instance of babun installed in Cygwin is located in the +/usr/local/etc/babun+ folder.
The folder structure looks like this:
----
├── babun
│   ├── external
│   │   └── oh-my-zsh
│   ├── home
│   │   ├── core
│   │   ├── oh-my-zsh
│   │   ├── pact

│   ├── installed
│   │   ├── babun
│   │   ├── cacert
│   │   ├── core
│   │   ├── git
│   │   ├── oh-my-zsh
│   │   ├── pact

└── babun.zsh

16 directories, 17 files
----

==== source

The folder contains the sources of babun checkout from github.

==== stamps

The folder contains files which modification time indicates certain things to babun. For example +babun check+ is execued automatically on babun's startup every 24 hours. Whenver it's invoked a file named +checked+ is being modified (the content of the modification does not matter).Whenever the mod_time of this file is not within 24 hours and babun is being started a +babun check+ will be invoked and the file +check+ located in the +stamps+ folder will be modifed again.

==== installed

The folder contains files that indicated which versions of babun's plugins and babun itself are installed. Each file cotanis a number - for example: a file named +core+ contains has one line with number +2+ in its content. It means that the pluing +core+ is installed and has version +2+

==== external

The folder contains external resources, like cloned repos of other projects (for example oh-my-zsh).

==== home

The folder contains folders named like plugins. If a plugin needs to install something to user's folder this content has to be copied to "home/<plugin_name>" folder. It's just a store of the user's home files, so that whenver a new user's account is created babun can install user's home related content to the user's home folder (it's the plugin install_home.sh script's responsibility, however, to copy this content to the actual user's home folder).
